#prepare the crab environment and
#get a proxy by running voms-proxy-init -voms cms

#get the list of files for the datasets you want to move by running
python FileList.py -q 'DAS_QUERY' -d 2

#give the valid query string between ''
#if dataset is listed in phys02 instance use -d 2

#for each dataset in the query it creates a file which includes the name of the files of teh dataset

#to start moving the files of each dataset run
chmod a+x move.sh
./move.sh DSFILENAME OLDUSERNAME

#you have to replace DSFILENAME with the name of the created file for the desired dataset in the previous step
#the OLDUSERNAME parameter is the user name that has created the dataset for the first time. Giving it, it will be replaced by your username in the ucsd Storage element


#wait for the download to complete

#To move the MT2tree's produced at UCSD to IPM, you need to make the list of the MT2trees. For example:
ls /hadoop/cms/store/user/paktinat/SMS-TChipChimStauSnu_mChi-120to500_mLSP-1to480_x-050_TuneZ2star_8TeV-pythia6-tauolapp/V03-09-01_SMS-TChipChimStauSnu_mChi-120to500_mLSP-1to480_x-050_8TeV-tauolapp/793ad2798b4297df0a6d87efecfc8bd6/MT2tree_* > SMS

#Then you can run the following
./moveToIPM.sh SMS

#wait for the download to complete ;)
